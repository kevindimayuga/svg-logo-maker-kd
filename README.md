# SVG Logo Maker

![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue)

M10 - This repo is a SVG Logo Maker that will generate a logo and save it as an SVG file based on the user's inputs to each prompt in the Node.js command-line application.

## Description

The challenge is an Job-seeking coding assessment or take-home assignment (no starter code is provided, we will build this web application by scratch). The goal is to build a Node.js command-line application that takes in user input to generate a logo and save it as an SVG file. The application prompts the user to select a color and shape, provide text for the logo, and save the generated SVG to a .svg file. I will be applying the skills I've learned in Javascript, Node.js and Object-oriented Programming (OOP). 

The motivation behind this project is to create a web application from scratch. It will help me utilize the skills jest, inquirer, javascript and node.js.
