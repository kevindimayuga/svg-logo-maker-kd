# SVG Logo Maker

This repo is for module ten's challenge assignment.


## Description

The challenge is an Job-seeking coding assessment or take-home assignment (no starter code is provided, we will build this web application by scratch). The goal is to build a Node.js command-line application that takes in user input to generate a logo and save it as an SVG file. The application prompts the user to select a color and shape, provide text for the logo, and save the generated SVG to a .svg file. I will be applying the skills I've learned in Javascript, Node.js and Object-oriented Programming (OOP). 

The motivation behind this project is to create a web application from scratch. It will help me utilize the skills jest, inquirer, javascript and node.js.
